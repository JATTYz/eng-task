# Stomble-task
## The objective of the task is to create a contact list (vCard) which either import from a device or import it manually.
### To run this project 
I created two folders which will be described below.
  - Go to the stomble_project folder which was built with React and dummy contacts (json-server) -> </br>
    Simply run the json server first by  type: **npm run server** </br>
    And then run React by type: **npm start** </br>
    
  - Go to the vCard_server folder which was built with node.js and used to store contact lists. </br>
    Simply run: **npm start**
    
note: some features are not implemented.
